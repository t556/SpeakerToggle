# SpeakerToggle
Small program to toggle sound devices. I have a shortcut on my windows desktop. This is to enable/disable my speakers quickly/easily. There is nothing worse than being in the office and my speakers are on and start playing sound, so I like to keep them disabled. However, sometimes I need them enabled for meetings. This program allows me to toggle it quickly.


These are commands I used to compile it:

g++ Disable.cpp -lsetupapi -o disable.exe
